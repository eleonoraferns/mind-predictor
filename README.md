# mind-predictor
This simple mind reader game uses the Claude-Shannon Algorithm to predict the playerâ€™s next move. 

How it works: 
The player is simply required to enter a number between 0 and 1, and the computer uses a random generator to choose a number as the predicted value. If the computer predicts the number correctly, the computer goes one point up, else the player scores. The game terminates when either of the two makes it to a pre-determined score.
